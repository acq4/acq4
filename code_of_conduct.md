Acq4 Code of Conduct
====================

Adapted from the [SciPy code of conduct](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/doc/source/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.rst).



Introduction
------------

This code of conduct applies to all public and private spaces managed by the 
acq4 project, including mailing lists, issue trackers, events, and any other 
communication channel used by our community.

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in
the acq4 community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the
project, in any project-related activities, and, especially, when representing the
project, in any role.

This code is neither exhaustive nor complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to
follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and
productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.


Specific guidelines
-------------------

We strive to:

1. Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use
   public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless
   discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or
   project-related support, too; not only is a public-support request much more
   likely to result in an answer to a question, it also ensures that any
   inadvertent mistakes in answering are more easily detected and corrected.

2. Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve
   conflict, and assume good intentions. We may all experience some frustration
   from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal
   attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
   productive one.

3. Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will
   depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the
   project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can
   build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect
   users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making
   decisions.

4. Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many
   problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may direct them to
   the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be responsive and helpful.

5. Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful in
   our communication and we take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to
   others. Do not insult or put down other participants. We will not accept
   harassment or other exclusionary behavior, such as:

  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly,
    or unlogged forums, such as IRC channel history, without the sender's consent.
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Excessive profanity. Please avoid swearwords; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.


Diversity statement
-------------------

The acq4 project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are
committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although
we may not always be able to accommodate each individual's preferences, we try
our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honor diversity in:
age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language,
national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race,
religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical
ability, to the extent that these do not conflict with this code of conduct.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, acq4 development is
conducted in English.
