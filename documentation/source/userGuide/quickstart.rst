Quick Start Guide
=================

Unfortunately, it is not likely that you will be getting started *quickly*. 

#. Follow instructions in the installation section. At the end of this, you should have python installed and an "acq4" directory branched via bazaar.
#. Create a set of configuration files in acq4/config/ by copying from acq4/config/backups/noyo/*.cfg 
#. start ACQ4 from the command line:

::
    
    \> cd acq4
    acq4\> python -i acq4.py

#. As acq4 starts up, it will attempt to initialize the devices described in the config files. Watch closely for error messages, make corrections to the config files, and try again.
#. Ask Luke for help. The documentation on configuration is not yet complete.
