acq4-0.9.3 (unreleased)

    API / behavior changes:
        Disabled HDF5 compression by default--lzf is not readable by most HDF5 libraries, and gzip is too slow. 
            (see the 'defaultCompression' config option).
        Tasks now have a default timeout to prevent endless tasks locking up the system. For tasks that
            require tolerance to long, unpredictable wait times (such as while waiting for an external 
            trigger), it is necessary to set {'protocol': {'timeout': None}}. Note that the TaskRunner
            disables the default timeout for exactly this reason.
    New Features:
        Timelapse + z-stack in camera module
        Motorized focus control interface in camera module
        Support for tracking and controlling micromanipulators from camera module
        Support for Scientifica PatchStar manipulators
        Spiral scanning for single-cell photostimulation
        Panic button: ESC key global shortcut closes shutters, stops stage/manipulator, aborts all tasks, etc.
        Overhaul of 2p Imager module:
            Uses services provided by scanner to provide raster scanning, which makes the behavior more consistent 
            with task runner.
            Shares image display code and user interface with cameras to make imaging consistent across device types
        MultiClamp can be used with 64-bit Python (by remote connection to a separate 32-bit Python)
        Support for Thorlabs MFC-1 focus controller using ROE-200 unused z-axis
        Added export option to ImageView
        Added new online analysis module for photostimulation (replaces old Uncaging module)
        Added support for controlling bidirectional filtering by NiDAQ device
        NoiseMonitor module for tracking long-term changes in electrical noise
        Added motion support to MPC200 device
        Objectives now have z-offset
    Bugfixes:
        Fixed issues with Scanner grid controls in TaskRunner
        Fixed issues with MultiClamp starting with wrong state in TaskRunner
        Cleaned up MultiClamp manager UI
        Fixed NiDAQ reporting incorrect sample rate in task runner
        Fixed problems with DockArea not restoring its state correctly
    Maintenance:
        Performance improvements for 2p imaging and stage input
        util.database now uses built-in sqlite3 module instead of QtSql

acq4-0.9.2 2014-01-10

    API / behavior changes:
        Performance improvements for Camera module, MP285
        generator pulse train parameter "interpulse_length" renamed to "period"
        Renamed "task" -> "taskRunner" for clarity in all TaskGui classes
        Simplified device config format by removing extra config: key from each device 
            (old format is still accepted)
        MultiClamp, Camera configs use 'defaults' instead of 'settings' 
        Slowed down Camera acquisition loop; it was eating too much CPU
    New Features:
        rudimentary "runner" bin/acq4, acq4.bat to start acq4
        Added --profile flag
        function generator now supports execution of multiple python statements rather than just eval()
        TaskRunner interface plots use downsampling and clip-to-view by default.
        Add ability to specify QCam device by unique ID
    Bugfixes:
        Fixed Camera module re-center on camera sensor area after objective switch
        fixed setup.py detection of git status
        Fixed inconsistencies in Laser.oputputPower()
            now returns _only_ the power value
        Fixed improper reload prefix
        Fixed bug when adding task runner analysis modules
        TaskRunner and Manager now stack new docks in tabs to avoid generating excessively large windows
        pg.MultiPlotItem imports correct metaarray module
        Removed calls to non-existent DAQ methods in mock DAQ
        Fix divide by zero in ViewBox
        InfiniteLine cache bounding rect for speedup
    Maintenance:
        Added .mailmap to correct the last 7 years of negligence.
        Removed duplicate entries from util.debug that also exist in pg.debug
        corrected column stretch in taskrunner sequence dock template, axopatch
        
        
acq4-0.9.1 2014-01-03

    API / behavior changes:
        Patch module defaults to -65 mV holding.
        Imager now uses config parameters to determine names of devices to use.
        Moved acq4.py script to acq4/__main__.py; now we start with python -m acq4
        Updated config search path
        setup.py install now copies config inside package install location
        Invert mock camera in example config--this makes stored images appear in
            the same orientation as they were recorded 
            (just to avoid unnecessary confusion)
        Slow down camera module until interactivity bug is handled
        CParser now requires explicit instruction to trigger a header re-parese.
        
    New Features:
        Added innosetup script for building Windows setup.exe
        Nicer demo message
        Added sigRemoved signal to Parameter class
        New grid system for scanner tasks
    Bugfixes:
        Minor fixes in pyqtgraph.
        Removed extra Log button from Manager gui
        Avoid unnecessary rebuild of Ni header cache
        Fixed behavior when no base dir is set
        Imager requests camera module load if it does not exist yet
        Add header cache files, .dll files to dist
        Fixed logging bugs:
            - documentation links work
            - fixed import error in util.debug that prevented errors being logged
            - log window no longer tries to follow its own links (these
              are handled externally)
        Doc link for no-storage-dir error
        Manager no longer creates index in baseDir; this is deferred until a file is added.
        Fixed setup.py config install path on linux
    Maintenance:
        Split documentation into its own repository.
        Many cleanups and additions to example config.
        Reorganized:
            - __init__ now handles most of what was previously in __main__
            - Manager now handles searching for config files
            - added CONFIGPATH global variable listing candidate search paths
        rebuildUi script now accepts path arguments
        cleaned up Manifest.in
        removed the 'storeSVG' and 'storePNG' buttons from the Canvas gui since 
          they were both broken and redundant with ViewBox's export system
        disabled ImageCorrection buttons in MosaicEditor
        fixes/cleanup of mosaic editor and cortexROI code, mosaic editor documentation
