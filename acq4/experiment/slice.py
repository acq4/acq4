    (-20e-6, -60e-6). Surface is found per tile, so the slab follows uneven
    tissue rather than being absolute stage z. Either ordering is accepted.

    scoring below it are not queued. `max_cell_density` is cells per cubic
    metre, above which a tile counts as already crowded and is skipped rather
    than having more targets packed into it. `rescans_allowed` permits
    re-imaging tiles that have already been covered.
